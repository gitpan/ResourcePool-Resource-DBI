=head1 DESCRIPTION


This class is used by the L<ResourcePool|ResourcePool> internally to create L<DBI|DBI> connections. Its called by the corresponding L<ResourcePool::Factory::DBI|ResourcePool::Factory::DBI> object which passes the parameters needed to establish the L<DBI|DBI> connection.

The only thing which has to been known by an application developer about this class is the implementation of the L<precheck()|/precheck> and L<postcheck()|/postcheck> methods:

=head2 S<$resource-E<gt>precheck>

Performs a $dbh->ping().

B<Returns:> Returns true on success and false on fail

=head2 S<$resource-E<gt>postcheck>

Performs a rollback() on the session if AutoCommit is off.

B<Returns:> always true
